# Challenge Web THCON 2025 - Cicadya
## Introduction
This is the challenge called "Cicadya" that I made for the [THCON 2025 ctf](https://ctftime.org/event/2660/).  
A lore was added to the challenge for the competition, but here is the original challenge.  
It has 2 flags, but you can go straight to the last one.  
The goal is to find the flag in the root folder of the web server.
